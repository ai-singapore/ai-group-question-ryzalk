# Instructions

You will be given a real-world scenario with a broad AI application.  Your task is to use data, algorithms and technical solutions creatively to deliver value, while keeping in mind the trade-offs different solutions present. Make use of the broad theme to reframe the task so it plays to your individual strengths and thinking skills. We are looking for chances to mark you positively; this is not a task to catch you out, so aim to be your best self and have fun. 

# Group Assignment

1. [Can Artificial Intelligence help Anne?](Scenario.md)

## How you should prepare: 

Read up on current real-world (not academic!) applications of Artificial Intelligence. WIRED.com, MIT Technology Review are good sources. Keynote speeches from companies like Google and Microsoft are also useful. These are available online and easily accessible. 

* Think about the data, algorithms and engineering trade-offs behind these applications.
* Think about the business value and users behind these applications as well. 
* Grab a beginner friend and explain what you have read to them. 
* Read up on project best practices eg. how to make your project reproducible by someone else. 

## What we are looking for: 

* Explain each step in your approach with clarity 
* Explain the thought processes behind your choice of approach. If needed, sketch out a solution. 
* Justify your choice of technical tools and metric of success. 
* Relate your solution to the business case and consider its feasibility.
* Include code documentation, steps for others to reproduce your solution, some awareness of how to deploy your solution in the real world and the trade-offs involved.

## Final presentation: 

* Focus on clarity above all else. 
* Slides, code with explanations or design sketches are all acceptable
* 5 minute only
* Suggested time allocation: 1 hour to scope and research the problem, 1 hour to prototype a solution, and 1 hour to hone your message and make your solution reproducible.

# Submission
